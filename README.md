Final Year Project: Pest Detection and Classification

Description: This project uses YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify and classify agricultural pests in images. It aims to assist farmers in identifying pest types to improve crop management.
 
Skills Demonstrated:
•	Object Detection
•	Python Programming
•	YOLOv5 Framework
•	Dataset Annotation
•	Transfer Learning
 
 
Required Skill Set:
•	Understanding of YOLO architecture
•	Proficiency in Python and PyTorch
•	Annotation tools like RoboFlow
•	Knowledge of transfer learning techniques

Summary: This project detects and classifies pests in images to provide insights into pest management. It includes training a YOLOv5 model on a custom dataset and fine-tuning for better performance.

Background Information: The project was developed as a Final Year Project (FYP) to address real-world agricultural problems using AI technologies. It emphasizes the practical application of object detection models in agriculture.
